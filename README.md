# 👋 Hey, I’m Temi

I’m a builder focused on turning ideas into working digital systems.

I work at the intersection of:
- 💻 Programming
- 🎨 Design
- ⚙️ Automation

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Building practical projects from scratch
- Improving my problem-solving and system thinking
- Shipping consistently instead of overthinking

## 🛠️ What I’m Working With
- Python — scripting, automation, problem-solving
- React — building interactive user interfaces
- HTML — semantic structure & layout
- Java — fundamentals & OOP concepts
- Git & GitHub — version control & collaboration
- Canva — image editing, light design & logo work

---

## 📌 Current Focus
- Strengthening fundamentals
- Building small but real projects
- Learning by doing (and breaking things)
